    "i ended up dropping all non numerical columns, that where normalized; however thanks to eda i felt confident about this choice.\n",
    "- dropped unnamed: 0 because it was an index placeholder\n",
    "- dropped track_name and lyrics dropped because lyrics had already been evaluated\n",
    "- release_date & age column where the same, but age was normalized, release_date got dropped \n",

Describe these clusters in human terms to the best of your ability using the columns in your dataset (for example high-gospel songs, low-gospel songs, etc).
